# DedupFS: A deduplicating FUSE file system written in Python

The Python script `dedupfs.py` implements a file system in user-space using
FUSE. It's called DedupFS because the file system's primary feature is
deduplication, which enables it to store virtually unlimited copies of files
because data is only stored once.

In addition to deduplication the file system also supports transparent
compression using any of the compression methods lzo, zlib and bz2.

These two properties make the file system ideal for backups: The author
currently stores 250 GB worth of backups using only 8 GB of disk space.

The design of DedupFS was inspired by Venti and ZFS.

## Usage

To use this script on Ubuntu (where it was developed) try the following:

    sudo apt-get install python-fuse
    git clone git://github.com/xolox/dedupfs.git
    mkdir mount_point
    python dedupfs/dedupfs.py mount_point
    # Now copy some files to mount_point/ and observe that the size of the two
    # databases doesn't grow much when you copy duplicate files again :-)
    # The two databases are by default stored in the following locations:
    #  - ~/.dedupfs-metastore.sqlite3 contains the tree and meta data
    #  - ~/.dedupfs-datastore.db contains the (compressed) data blocks

## Status

Development on DedupFS began as a proof-of-concept to find out how much disk
space the author could free by employing deduplication to store his daily
backups. Since then it's become more or less usable as a way to archive old
backups, i.e. for secondary storage deduplication. It's not recommended to
use the file system for primary storage though, simply because the file system
is too slow. I also wouldn't recommend depending on DedupFS just yet, at least
until a proper set of automated tests has been written and successfully run to
prove the correctness of the code (the tests are being worked on).

The file system initially stored everything in a single SQLite database, but it
turned out that after the database grew beyond 8 GB the write speed would drop
from 8-12 MB/s to 2-3 MB/s. Therefor the file system now stores its data blocks
in a separate database, which is a persistent key/value store managed by dbm.

## Dependencies

This script requires the Python FUSE binding in addition to several Python
standard libraries like `anydbm`, `sqlite3`, `hashlib` and `cStringIO`.
